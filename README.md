# CalendarProject
The user has the ability to click on the different calendar dates to change the current date to the clicked date. This will move the cyan highlight to the current day clicked and update the current data for the calendar's date. Besides changing the date, the user has the ability to click on the "Day" "week" "Month" and "Agenda" buttons to view the events set for the current day/week/month. As for the "Agenda" button, the program creates a pop up display asking the user to enter two dates. This will display all the events between the two entered dates.

The calendar's view can be traversed by clicking the "<" or ">" buttons above the calendar. Based on if the user clicked on the Day/Week/Month button, the calendar's current day will be changed to the previous/next day/week/month. The user has the ability to return to the current date by clicking the "Today" button. Besides the three main buttons above the calendar, the calendar can go to the next or previous month by clicking the "<" or ">" icons inside the calendar area. 

The "From File" button takes recurring events from a text file (see input.txt for the recurring events format) and populates the calendar with the events.

The "Light" and "Dark" buttons change the panel to the right that shows the current events to be in either light or dark mode. Light mode is set on default, which is black text on white background. Dark mode inverts the colors: white text on black background.
